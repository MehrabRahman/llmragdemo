# Project 1
Fork this project and refactor. Use a HuggingFace model of your choosing, set your environment variable for 'API_TOKEN' (which you get from your Profile -> Access Tokens menu on HuggingFace). 

Ways to refactor:
- Expand the application to multiple files (libraries)
- Expand to a main function + various other methods
- Expand to OOP
- Load documents (txt files, etc) as context, to simulate a RAG
- Expand to incorporate a Text UI
- Load a dataset into a vector database
- Query the database for your context to answer the user
